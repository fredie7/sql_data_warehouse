#### PROCEDURE
The project follows through with the above predefined architecture, which begins with importing the datasets provided as CSV files into the staging area, before being exported to the bronze layer. Data cleaning at the silver layer becomes imperative to resolve inconsistencies to ensure that every record adheres to standard quality practices. Afterward, a detailed data quality check is conducted to verify that the datasets conformed to the defined schema, maintained completeness, and reflected accuracy in line with the overall business context. \
